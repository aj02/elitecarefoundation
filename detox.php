                            In achieving sobriety by completing a detox program, patients can ward off the risk of relapse
that may make it harder to resist temptation in the long run. By choosing a treatment program
that offers detox as an initial phase of care, you will experience the following benefits:
<ol>
<li>
The risk of continuing to abuse your substance(s) of choice is virtually eliminated as
detox programs are housed in substance-free environments.
</li>
<li>
Rather than face withdrawal alone, you will be surrounded by caring and experienced
professionals who will offer support throughout the detox treatment process.
</li>
<li>
Further damages to your mental and physical health will be eliminated as your
substance abuse is halted after completing a detox program
</li>
<li>
Certain prescription medications can be provided to make you more comfortable during
your time in detox.
</li>

</ol>
These immediate benefits of participating in a detox program will help you make the most of the
support available to you in the early days of recovery and will set the stage for continued
success both during treatment and after you return to your home environment.
