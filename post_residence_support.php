                        A practical component of residential treatment is setting clients up for success after they leave
their treatment program. If clients are able to practice and begin using skills and resources while
in treatment, they are more likely to be able to maintain their recovery in the months and years
following rehab.     
						</p>
						<p class="margin-b35">
						These types of strategies can include follow-up interviews to check in and provide motivation for
continued commitment or encouragement to join mutual recovery groups and fellowships, such
as 12-Step or alternative support programs.

                        Principles of Effective Treatment
						</p>
                        <p class="margin-b35">


Based on scientific research since the mid-1970s, the following key principles should form the
basis of any effective treatment program:
<ol>
<li>
Addiction is a complex but treatable disease that affects brain function and behavior.
</li>
<li>
No single treatment is right for everyone.
</li>
<li>
People need to have quick access to treatment.
</li>
<li>
Effective treatment addresses all of the patient’s needs, not just his or her drug use.
</li>
<li>
Staying in treatment long enough is critical.
</li>
<li>
Counseling and other behavioral therapies are the most commonly used forms of
treatment.
</li>
<li>
Medications are often an important part of treatment, especially when combined with
behavioral therapies.
</li>
<li>
Treatment plans must be reviewed often and modified to fit the patient’s changing
needs.
</li>
<li>
Treatment should address other possible mental disorders.
</li>
<li>
Medically assisted detoxification is only the first stage of treatment.
</li>
<li>
Treatment doesn&#39;t need to be voluntary to be effective.
</li>
<li>
12. Drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously.
</li>
<li>
13. Treatment programs should test patients for HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, tuberculosis,
and other infectious diseases as well as teach them about steps they can take to reduce
their risk of these illnesses.
</li>
<li>
14. Evaluation and treatment for co-occurring mental health issues such as depression and
anxiety
</li>

</ol>
<br>
<br>
One of these studies found that adding CBT to a slow taper of benzos for people with anxiety
disorders was more helpful in reducing benzo use than the slow taper alone. Three months after
treatment, 77 percent of those who had received both the slow taper and the therapy remained
in recovery.
